			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
			<br>
				Hello!<br>
				<br>
				I'm Johnny and I'm looking for a challenging and exciting new work experience. I want to work in an environment where there's always meaningful work to be done, and I can feel like I'm making a difference. I want an experience that is engaging and makes me feel like an important part of a team.<br>
				<br>
				My ideal position is at a startup or emerging company. I like the vibe that usually comes with these sorts of organizations and they seem to have more potential for making real differences. The idea of being part of a small, promising company with big dreams really appeals to me.<br>
				<br>
				That being said, I wouldn't mind working for a larger company, provided I was doing something worthwhile. I don't want to be just another cog in a corporate machine. Specifically, I'd prefer a role on a small team working on something new and innovative.<br>
				<br>
				Currently I'm a full-time student, and only free to work remotely and part-time during the school year. During summers I can relocate and work as a full-time employee. As an added bonus, if you get me hooked on something cool, there's a strong chance I'll come back to work for you full-time after graduation.
